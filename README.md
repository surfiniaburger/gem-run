## MLB GUMBO Data Access

A primary data source for this hackathon will be MLB's GUMBO (Grand Unified Master Baseball Object) data feeds, which are available without authentication.

### About GUMBO
The GUMBO (Grand Unified Master Baseball Object) live data feed provides a standardized JSON response that summarizes the entire state of a selected game upon each update. Unlike previous live event data feeds, GUMBO provides complete game information with every object creation, rather than incremental updates.

### Key Benefits

- **Complete Game State**: No need to maintain game state locally or build upon message sequences - each GUMBO object includes complete and current dataset for the entire game
- **Standard JSON Format**: GUMBO follows true JSON standards, unlike previous feed formats
- **Flexible Access Methods**: Available via:
  - Websocket listener (push updates every 1-2 seconds)
  - Stats API (pull updates every 12 seconds)
- **Development-Friendly**: Use actual production data for development at any time without requiring scheduled test data delivery

### API Endpoints

Access GUMBO data using these base URLs (replace `{game_pk}` with the specific game ID):

1. **Current Game State**:
   ```
   https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1.1/game/{game_pk}/feed/live
   ```

2. **Specific Game Timestamp**:
   ```
   https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1.1/game/{game_pk}/feed/live?timecode=yyyymmdd_######
   ```

3. **List of Game Update Timestamps**:
   ```
