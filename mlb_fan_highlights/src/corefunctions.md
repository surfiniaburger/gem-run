Selection Options: The interface would need to allow users to select:
Specific MLB teams they want to follow.
Specific MLB players they want to follow.
Potentially other filters based on game types, highlights, etc
Digest Customization: Users should be able to:
Choose the media type(s) they want to receive (audio, video, text, or combinations).
Set the desired frequency of the digests (e.g., daily, weekly, after each game).
Select their preferred language (English, Spanish, or Japanese).
Output:
The system needs to generate the selected digests (audio, video, and/or text) based on their settings.
Language Selection: The interface would need to have clear controls or options that allow users to select the language (English, Spanish, or Japanese) for the user interface and for the content of the highlights.
Visual Elements:

The interface would need elements such as:

Dropdown Menus/Selection Lists: For selecting teams and players.
Checkboxes/Radio Buttons: To select output media and language.
Frequency Options: For selecting the timing for the digests.
Clear and Concise Labels: To guide users in choosing their selections
In addition, the system could include options for users to:

See examples of what the digests will look like before they confirm their subscription.
Change their settings at any time.
The challenge specifically mentions using data from MLB and tools from Google Cloud. The interface would need to connect with the back-end services accessing those data sources and using those Google AI tools.
