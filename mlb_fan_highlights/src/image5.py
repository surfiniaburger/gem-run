    Welcome, everyone, to today's podcast! Today is October 9, 2024. We're going to recap the Yankees' last
    game. All game data and statistics are sourced from the MLB Stats API. The Yankees played against the Orioles on May 2, 2024. According to the MLB Stats API, the final score was 4-2, with the Yankees winning.
    
    This was a really solid game for the Yankees. They managed to put up a strong offensive performance, but their real strength was in their solid pitching and defense.
    
    Let's dive into some of the key moments. In the top of the 1st inning, with one out, and a runner on first, Juan Soto came to the plate. Data from the MLB Stats API shows that he hit a home run on a 1-1 count, driving in 2 runs. The score after the play was 2-0, Yankees leading.
    
    That home run by Soto really set the tone for the game. He's been having an incredible season so far, and that hit was a testament to his ability to deliver in clutch situations.
    
    I was just trying to stay locked in and put a good swing on the ball. It was a good pitch to hit, and I connected.
    
    In the bottom of the 3rd inning, with no outs and runners on first and second, Anthony Santander hit a single, driving in one run. The score was then 2-1.
    
    The Orioles managed to get one back there, capitalizing on some baserunners.
    
    We were trying to get some runs on the board. That hit got us a bit closer.
    
    Then, in the top of the 4th, with two outs, Gleyber Torres hit a home run, extending the Yankees' lead to 3-1.
    
    Torres really came through there with a crucial hit, adding an insurance run for the Yankees.
    
    I got a good pitch to hit and I didn't miss it.
    
    In the top of the 9th, Jose Trevino singled, driving in another run, putting the Yankees up 4-1.
    
    Another insurance run here, and it came at a crucial time.
    
    Just doing what I can to extend our lead and make things tough on them.
    
    Finally, in the bottom of the 9th inning, with one out, Ryan Mountcastle homered, bringing the score to 4-2. That was the end of the scoring though, as the Yankees defense closed it out.
    
    A little late-game surge from the Orioles, but ultimately not enough to overcome the Yankees' lead.
    
    We tried to rally there at the end, but fell a bit short.
    
    Let's take a look at some of the key player stats from the game, according to the MLB Stats API. For the Yankees, Juan Soto went 1 for 4 with a home run, 2 RBIs, and 1 run. Gleyber Torres also went 1 for 4, hitting a home run, with 1 RBI and 1 run. On the Orioles side, Anthony Santander went 2 for 4 with 1 RBI. Ryan Mountcastle went 1 for 4 with 1 Home Run, 1 RBI and 1 run.
    
    And for the pitchers, The MLB Stats API reports that for the Yankees, Luis Gil pitched 5.2 innings, allowing 4 hits, 1 earned run, and 3 walks, with 8 strikeouts. For the Orioles, Grayson Rodriguez pitched 6.0 innings, allowing 5 hits, 3 Earned Runs, and 0 walk, while striking out 5.
    
    Overall, a great performance from the Yankees, backed by strong pitching and timely hitting. The Orioles fought hard but couldn't quite match the Yankees' output.
