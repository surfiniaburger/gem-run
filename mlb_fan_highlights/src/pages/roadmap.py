st.markdown("""
This page outlines the current capabilities and future direction of the MLB AI Highlights Generator project.
Our goal is to create a fully automated system that transforms raw MLB game data into engaging, multi-asset media summaries.

# --- Current Status ---

st.markdown("""
The agent currently performs the following steps upon receiving a target game (identified by team selection):

1.  **Planning:** Analyzes the request and plans data retrieval steps.
2.  **Data Retrieval:**
    *   Fetches structured game metadata and play-by-play data from BigQuery.
    *   Performs vector search on BigQuery for relevant narrative snippets (summaries, etc.).
    *   Looks up player IDs and names from a metadata table.
3.  **Content Generation (Dialogue):** Generates an initial two-host dialogue script based on retrieved data.
4.  **Web Search & Refinement:**
    *   Critiques the initial draft for accuracy, engagement, and data usage.
    *   If needed, generates web search queries (using Tavily) to fetch external context based on the critique.
    *   Revises the dialogue script, incorporating critique and web search results. (Loops up to 2 times).
5.  **Static Asset Retrieval:**
    *   Analyzes the final script for team and player names.
    *   Retrieves team logos via vector search (against an indexed logo dataset).
    *   Retrieves player headshots via direct lookup (using Player ID and GCS path).
6.  **Generative Visuals:**
    *   Analyzes the final script to create descriptive text prompts for key moments (avoiding names/teams for model safety).
    *   Generates images using **Vertex AI Imagen 3**. Includes fallback to Cloudflare Workers AI if Imagen fails.
    *   Critiques the generated images against the script. (Loops up to 2 times).
    *   Generates short video clips (Text-to-Video) using **Vertex AI Veo** based on the image prompts.
7.  **Audio Generation:**
    *   Generates a multi-speaker audio track (**Vertex AI TTS**) matching the final dialogue script, alternating voices line-by-line.
8.  **Output:** Collects and presents the final script, retrieved static assets (logos, headshots), generated images, generated video clips, and the generated audio file URI.

**Data Source:** Primarily relies on 2024 MLB season data loaded into BigQuery tables for this demonstration phase.

# --- Detailed Future Plans ---
st.header("‚û°Ô∏è Next Steps & Future Plans")

st.subheader("Immediate Focus: Assembly Line")
st.markdown("""
*   **Goal:** Automatically combine the generated assets (script, audio, images, videos) into a cohesive final product.
*   **Implementation:** Develop a final agent node or separate process that acts as an "assembly line".
    *   **Challenge 1: Synchronization:** Accurately timing visual changes (showing specific images/videos) to match the corresponding points in the audio narration. This might involve:
        *   Timestamping the script using the TTS API's capabilities (if available).
        *   Using another LLM call to analyze the script and audio to create a detailed storyboard/edit decision list (EDL).
    *   **Challenge 2: Tooling:** Utilizing libraries like `moviepy` (Python) or orchestrating `ffmpeg` commands to perform the video editing tasks (overlaying images, inserting video clips, adding audio).
*   **Potential Outputs:**
    *   **Standard Video File (.mp4):** A straightforward video recap suitable for sharing. Images might use simple effects (like Ken Burns pan/zoom).
    *   **Interactive HTML/JS Card:** A web-based component where the script text is displayed, audio plays, and the relevant visual asset appears alongside the text dynamically. Offers more user engagement.

""")

st.subheader("Long-Term Vision")
st.markdown("""
*   **Real-time Capability:** Integrate with live MLB data APIs for near real-time recap generation.
*   **Deeper Analysis & Storytelling:** Incorporate more advanced stats (wOBA, FIP, etc.), historical context, and automated detection of narrative arcs within the game.
*   **Advanced Visuals:** Explore generating visualizations of player tracking data (e.g., pitch paths, defensive routes) or using more sophisticated video editing techniques.
*   **Customization & Control:** Allow users more control over the desired style, length, and focus of the generated highlights.
*   **Alternative Output Formats:** Generate written articles, social media snippets, or even VR experiences based on the game data and generated assets.
