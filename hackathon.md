Requirements
What to Build
Use the MLB™-provided datasets, public datasets, and Google Cloud AI tools to build a project for baseball fans within one of the following Challenges:

Wild Card Challenge 1: Come up with your own MLB™ fan engagement project!
Use any of the data sets provided, public datasets, and Google Cloud AI tools to build a project for baseball fans. What will you dream up to next-level the MLB™ fan experience with Google Cloud? 

Challenge 2: Personalized Fan Highlights: Build a system that allows fans to select team(s), player(s), etc. to follow and create audio, video, and/or text digests that fans could receive on a regular cadence to stay up on the latest highlights and commentary. Ensure your solution supports fans who speak English, Spanish, and Japanese. 

Challenge 3: Real-Time “Tool Tips”: Build a model and showcase its use in an interactive application that provides real-time insights into baseball strategy for casual viewers, explaining the tactics behind each play as the game unfolds.

Challenge 4: Generate Statcast Data from Old Videos: Create a tool that extracts fundamental Statcast metrics (e.g., pitch speed, exit velocity) from archival game videos using computer vision. 

Challenge 5: Prospect Prediction: Build a platform predicting a prospect’s MLB™ potential, projecting career impact based on current performance and historical comparisons.
